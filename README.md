## 🏎️ Salifort Motors – Predicting Employee Turnover Using Machine Learning (Capstone)

A machine learning classification project completed as the final capstone for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
This project builds and evaluates predictive models to determine whether an employee will leave Salifort Motors. By analyzing HR data—such as satisfaction levels, department, salary, and workload—the analysis provides data-driven recommendations to leadership to improve employee retention and organizational health.



### 📌 Project Objectives
* Analyze HR Data: Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the primary drivers of employee attrition.
  
* Feature Engineering: Transform categorical variables and handle outliers in features like employee tenure.
  
* Predict Attrition: Build and tune machine learning models to predict the binary "left" variable.
  
* Model Comparison: Evaluate Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests using various performance metrics.
  
* Strategic Recommendations: Provide actionable insights for the HR department to reduce turnover and improve employee satisfaction.

* Ethical Oversight: Ensure data privacy, anonymity, and fairness to prevent bias in model implementation.

  

### 🧰 Technologies Used
* Python 3
  
* Data Manipulation: pandas, NumPy
  
* Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
  
* Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
  
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


  
### 📊 Key Insights
* Critical Drivers: Employee turnover is highly correlated with job satisfaction levels, the number of projects handled, and average monthly working hours.
  
* Retention Risk: Employees with very high workloads (frequent overwork) or very low satisfaction scores are the most likely to leave.
  
* Model Performance: The Random Forest model emerged as the champion, significantly outperforming Logistic Regression in predictive power.
  
* Final Random Forest Metrics (Typical):
F1 Score: ≈ 0.94
Accuracy: ≈ 0.98

* Feature Importance: Analysis reveals that "number of projects" and "tenure" are among the most critical predictors of an employee's decision to stay or go.
  
* Business Impact: By utilizing the Random Forest model for real-time insights, the HR department can design targeted retention programs to safeguard against high turnover rates.
